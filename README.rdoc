== NYCDA BE Lesson 7: <i>Basic Rails App</i>
A project that I created during my New York Code + Design Academy Back End 101 class in New York after Week 4 Lecture 2. This project was a Ruby web application using Rails.

=== Assignment:
Create a new Rails application for a blog with a Post model and Posts controller. The app should have two views: One that lists all posts and one that shows the details of a specific post.

When a user navigates to the root path of your app, they should be directed to a view that lists all posts.
